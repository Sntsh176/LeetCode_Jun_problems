130. Surrounded Regions     Medium

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in
that surrounded region.

Example:

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

Explanation:
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border,
which means that any 'O' on the border of the
board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is
not on the border and it is not connected to
an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent
cells connected horizontally or vertically.
